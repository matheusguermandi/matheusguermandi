## Hello there :)

I'm Matheus, a software engineer with hands-on experience in diverse market settings, ranging from startups to established unicorns and corporations. My expertise revolves around the JavaScript ecosystem, encompassing Node.js, React, and TypeScript, while also having an affinity for Java and PHP. My enthusiasm for continuous learning fuels my drive to explore and master new technologies.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I am immersing myself in learning about Clean Architecture, Design Patterns, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Test-Driven Development (TDD) as I strive to refine my architectural and design skills.

Recently I've achieved my Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Practitioner and Developer Associate certification - so, you can check it here:
